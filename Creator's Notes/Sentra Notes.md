Hello, I'm Baihaki, or better known as Bai! I'm a software engineer, I work in automation and also AI. 

I'm building Sentra, a sovereign agent or living digital organism, previously when i was working on Sentra, it revolves around local LLM, I wrote "tools" and extend capabilites of it for example using the browser and collect information and etc. It was not complete, but I feel, the real bottleneck is LLM, which slows down the project. Then, I thought to myself, why must we use LLM in the first place? can we just teach a living digital organism from scratch? So I was thinking, why not build the brain, the "scaffold" then we feed data into it? this scaffold acts as a digital brain that process these data, remembers, optimize and so on just like how our brain works. I said to myself "why not". And right now, I question myself, whether this scaffold that im building right now have enough tables or not, whether these algorithms is receiving what it needs and process exactly how our brain does, whether new information would "fall" into the right place. The idea is when we where born, we are given an "empty brain", it already have hippocampus and so on. The idea is, build a empty digital brain, and our only job after that is feed data, millions of data. The advantage of this, we dont need to retrain models like traditional LLMs do, it retracts, receive, process, delegate data by itself. And I dont believe in the idea of in order to power AI, we need massive computations. Evidence? the evidence is our brain which has 80-100billions of neurons and only run around 20W.And, I'm just so obsessed with this idea, and mind refused to sleep on it!

okay since you understood what Sentra is about, what is the file directory should be and looks like? i mean the base folder, files etc. or the Scaffold of it, and i want to see the extended version of how we store data, the tables and stuff. and If I could direct an AI to build this "digital brain" in one prompt, what would it look like?

well how about scaling? will this default template digital brain be scalable for accomodate language processing (input and output), intent recognition, process skills and so on?

good good, but not just language i think, there is just something that i see as problems in the future but i am not sure, this is why, building this template and locking in file directory without introducing new one is important, like, you wont see anyones brain on earth just grow larger like cancer or grow another limb on his head, we dont add another function to what brain has already to offer, our only job is feed it knowledge and skills, same idea applies here. we must build a scaffold that is just "ready" for anything that is to come. I dont care about visual perception yet, that can be introduced later, this AI can be blind, deaf, and limbless for now. I just want to avoid writing new files so much, i want to lockdown the file directory and work only on the files that we have. do you get me?

I also questions about Sentra's language and cognitive capabilities itself, can he know he is Sentra? can he know me? can he tell me and a cat or a dog apart? Can he pass Turing Test in the future? Can he really learn languages from scratch? how do I teach him; what is "is", what is "what", can he handle numorous topics, and classify contexts apart, can he handle thousands and thousands of intents and entities, and define what what is what; apart, while keeping him able to do complex tasks. Building this scaffold has been eating me away, I can't figure it out. it drives me mad and crazy. How can someone be atheis? We human underestimated the question "who made us" too much. There's definitely an All-Knowing Creator out there. You think that something as super-complex like "brain" is made from nothing? natural selection??? Are we deadass believing in that shit ?? 🙄🙄🙄 


All praises to God, the All-Mighty. 
I have an idea! Do you sense that in our head that we have an inner voice? This inner voice, I call it the "The Last One", this node in particular is the actual outputs of neurons firing together and it feed them to ourselves. It doesnt move left to right or up or down, it moves by someone's own intent. For example, if someone wants to eat something, and think of a burger, the node grabs neurons which what's already in the galaxy of neurons that are related to "burger". then sometimes drift's abit, that's why we never can't write on the keyboard completely with 100% accuracy compared to what we actually wanna say. because it drifts abit, and collect unrelated information. Or another example, to visualize this; imagine on a table there's a thousands of tiny sphere magnets, most of them are coloured white (neurons or node) then there's this just one slightly bigger magnet than the rest of them (the last one, still a neuron, still a node of them). Now imagine if you move this slightly bigger magnet around the table, the other magnets must attract to it, and brings that is closer to other magnets together as well. its like a web of connection as long as the bigger magnet moves. does this make sense to you?

Another example: A submarine with flashlights in the head, the flashlight is the "Last One", it illuminates the path, and the submarine is the "Scaffold", it moves around the path and collects information.

Another example: A Role Playing GTA game: where you only see what's around you, but other stuff around the world still exists, it's just you who dont see it. You only perceive what's around you, not all of the game's content and all entirety.


FUTURE AND FURTHER IDEAS:
- Generate thousands of relational inputs (example: Dog is an animal) using AI, then feed it to the Sentra.

- Find approach of using weighted model that doesnt have to be trained over and over.

- I saw that most image recognition or OCR, doesnt have attention-like mechanism, it just see the image as a whole, and output the result. How can we make it more like human? where we focus on the specific part of the image to identify certain stuff? I find this idea intriguing, this may improve image recognition and performance as awhole. 


QUESTIONS, THOUGHTS, AND RESEACH:
- If my attention-like mechanism for image recognition is good, can it be applied to language recognition too? Will it be compatible with my text-based attention-like mechanism? 

- How much data is needed, and what type of data is needed, to make/train Sentra a good conversationalist? 100Gb  1TB? 10TB? 100TB?

- Can Sentra generate texts without relying on LLMs or APIs at all? or is there any possibility to create a text generator from scratch?

- Can Sentra learn on the go, without retraining? or is there any possibility to create a learning system that doesnt have to be trained over and over?

- Can Sentra learn on the go, without going to sleep mode?

- Is the DB/memory system scalable enough to handle and accommodate multi-modal inputs soon?

- Ignoring the audio for now, I just think that audio is pretty much the same as text, just a different format, right? We just process audio like youtube transcription (or build one from scratch) then feed it into the same stream. so we have soon is text, image, and audio into one stream, into one pipeline? And i find this idea, will stale the performance in the future. But this is just another unimportant issue for now.

- I find the idea of building something from sratch fascinating, but I also find it terrifying. I don't know why and when I become like this, maybe it's just trust issues, or maybe it's just the fear of the unknown. I don't know. 

FINAL THOUGHTS:

- In all honesty, I don't know whether I will succeed or comes to the term of myself where im satisfied with the outcome of this project. But I know one thing for sure, I will never regret the process of creating this project. This is the most meaningful and fulfilling project that I've ever worked on, and I'm proud of myself for even starting it. This project, made me realize, and strengthened my belief that God truly exists. Because in pursuit of knowledge, I stumbled upon the path where things will stays unknown. Because something so complex like a "brain", can't just emerge out of nothing. Impossible. The complexity, the reliability, the perfect balance of it. It's just so divine and complete. A masterpiece. Crafted by the greatest creator, designer, inventor, and engineer of all, among all realms. Verily, God is the Greatest.

- Well, to justify what I'm doing right now is crazy, I know. Whenever I feel lazy, or I lost the motivation or lost the novelty of creating an AI from scratch from a small apartment in Razak City. Please remember future me; that you've studied music for over than 8+ years now. You've made dozens of music and proved to yourself that you can arrange, mix and master music by yourself. Beaten the whole country and proved that you're one of the BEST music producer that is on 99th percentile of Malaysia's population. ONE OF THE BEST. Even made so money with it, went out to the hometown and other cities to perform infront of thousands of people, then these people asked "what is music to you?" but still answered "it's just a hobby". while juggling 9-6 as a software engineer and yeah you've proved that you're good at it, infact, good in anything that you'd take interest in, whatever piques your interest... What a fucking feat! Just imagine what would you do and achieve for this project that you acknowledge as your "life's work" and the project of your lifetime? This is beyond fancy clothes or bitches, big cars and mansions and money coming in. This whole paragraph should be enough to motivate you on the long-run. Read it when you need it. Do it with God, do it in silence, do it when youre lazy, do it when you're stuck, i dont care if you're down or low. You keep on going. You don't stop.

All praises to God the All-Knowing, the All-Mighty. To infinite knowledge, and absolute novelty. Godspeed.
