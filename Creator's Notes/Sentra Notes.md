Hello, I'm Baihaki, or a better known as Bai. I'm a software engineer, I work in automation and also AI. 

I'm building Sentra, a sovereign agent or living digital organism, previously when i was working on Sentra, it revolves around local LLM, I wrote "tools" and extend capabilites of it for example using the browser and collect information and etc. It was not complete, but I feel, the real bottleneck is LLM, which slows down the project. Then, I thought to myself, why must we use LLM in the first place? can we just teach a living digital organism from scratch? So I was thinking, why not build the brain, the "scaffold" then we feed data into it? this scaffold acts as a digital brain that process these data, remembers, optimize and so on just like how our brain works. I said to myself "why not". And right now, I question myself, whether this scaffold that im building right now have enough tables or not, whether these algorithms is receiving what it needs and process exactly how our brain does, whether new information would "fall" into the right place. The idea is when we where born, we are given an "empty brain", it already have hippocampus and so on. The idea is, build a empty digital brain, and our only job after that is feed data, millions of data. The advantage of this, we dont need to retrain models like traditional LLMs do, it retracts, receive, process, delegate data by itself. And I dont believe in the idea of in order to power AI, we need massive computations. Evidence? the evidence is our brain which has 80-100billions of neurons and only run around 20W.

okay since you understood what Sentra is about, what is the file directory should be and looks like? i mean the base folder, files etc. or the Scaffold of it, and i want to see the extended version of how we store data, the tables and stuff. and If I could direct an AI to build this "digital brain" in one prompt, what would it look like?

well how about scaling? will this default template digital brain be scalable for accomodate language processing (input and output), intent recognition, process skills and so on?

good good, but not just language i think, there is just something that i see as problems in the future but i am not sure, this is why, building this template and locking in file directory without introducing new one is important, like, you wont see anyones brain on earth just grow larger like cancer or grow another limb on his head, we dont add another function to what brain has already to offer, our only job is feed it knowledge and skills, same idea applies here. we must build a scaffold that is just "ready" for anything that is to come. I dont care about visual perception yet, that can be introduced later, this AI can be blind, deaf, and limbless for now. I just want to avoid writing new files so much, i want to lockdown the file directory and work only on the files that we have. do you get me?

I also questions about Sentra's language capabilities itself, can he know he is Sentra? can he know me? can he tell me and a cat or a dog apart? Can he pass Turing Test in the future? Can he really learn languages from scratch? how do I teach him; what is "is", what is "what", can he handle numorous topics, and contexts apart, can he handle thousands and thousands of intents and entities, and define what what is what; apart, while keeping him able to do complex tasks. Building this scaffold has been eating me away, I can't figure it out. it drives me mad and crazy. How can someone be atheis? We human underestimated the question "who made us" too much. There's definitely an All-Knowing Creator out there. All praises to God, the All-Mighty. 

I have an idea! Do you sense that in our head that we have an inner voice? This inner voice, I call it the "The Last One", this node in particular is the actual outputs of neurons firing together and it feed them to ourselves. It doesnt move left to right or up or down, it moves by someone's own intent. For example, if someone wants to eat something, and think of a burger, the node grabs neurons which what's already in the galaxy of neurons that are related to "burger". then sometimes drift's abit, that's why we never can't write on the keyboard completely with 100% accuracy compared to what we actually wanna say. because it drifts abit, and collect unrelated information. Or another example, to visualize this; imagine on a table there's a thousands of tiny sphere magnets, most of them are coloured white (neurons or node) then there's this just one slightly bigger magnet than the rest of them (the last one, still a neuron, still a node of them). Now imagine if you move this slightly bigger magnet around the table, the other magnets must attract to it, and brings that is closer to other magnets together as well. its like a web of connection as long as the bigger magnet moves. does this make sense to you?
